I’ve been learning web development for about 2 years, while studying in this university on the side: University of Indonesia, Bachelor Program (S1) of Business Administration, minoring in Finance. My latest GPA (IPK) is 3.58.</p>
<p>My work experience: internship at Insyst Media Solutions, a web design and branding agency, as a full-stack developer.</p></div><div class="col-md-3"></div></div><div class="row text-left"><div class="col-md-4"><p>I'm an aspiring professional full stack web developer, excited and eager to contribute to and to learn from a team that follows good software development practices and processes.</p>
<p>I want to feel proud of my work. I want a job where I can pour all my passion and skill into it without being seen by my coworkers as a stupid, clueless, overactive employee.</p>
<p>I see your job opening at StackOverflow and I sincerely hope that what’s written there is really true. Assuming what’s written there is true, I’m very excited to grow and contribute with your team at <strong>BukaLapak</strong>.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><p>While I’m fairly confident of my capability to learn things fast without much supervision, I understand the company’s need for output and performance, and I also want to be able to hit the ground running. If my current technical capability is insufficient to give enough value to the company, I’ll let go of this opportunity to work with your team, so that I can focus on improving my skills first.</p>
<p>I’m currently at the phase where I can read technical documentation easily and generate clean enough code to create a functional web application. However, I’m not yet fully proficient in things that make the application robust, such as: testing, documentation, security, software development methodologies, etc.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><p>Here're some projects of mine that may demonstrate my current technical capability:</p><ol><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>A List of Programming Books that I've Read (API) using MEAN stack.</li><li>This page (Responsive, HTML+CSS Validated) using Bootstrap and pug.js (with pug-cli in bash).</li><li><a href="https://repl.it/Jrbp/6" target="_blank">CLRS Merge Sort Algorithm</a> (Readable, Tests) using vanilla javascript and repl.it.
